## Data Verbosity & Philosophy

This repository prioritizes **verbose data delivery**. We believe that providing granular, situational, and detailed policy information is essential for ensuring all members fully understand their duties and club protocols. This approach powers both the manual FAQ sections and the Experimental AI Assistant, aiming to eliminate ambiguity in complex membership scenarios.

## Contact & Support

If you have questions, require clarification on policies, or wish to report issues or errors in this knowledge base, please contact the Club Secretary.
